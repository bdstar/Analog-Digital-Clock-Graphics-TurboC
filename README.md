# Analog-Digital clock with interactive animation using TurboC graphics

This is a mini project of Analog and Digital clock with interactive animation for Turbo C / C++ graphics.

## Background

Hello! This is a sample Clock application with animation that was my graduate-level 3rd-semester project and it was developed by the TurboC compiler. So Let get started…

## Introduction

This article is especially for students who are developing to interesting mini-project with help of TurboC graphics. My present project is a simple Clock application project that is developed by TurboC graphics. In this project, I was used a keyboard event to control the interface and also showed some interactive animation for the turboC graphics. 

## Requirement
Firstly, you need to TurboC compiler to execute and run the code. 
Secondly, graphic mode functions require a graphics monitor (at least 640x480) and adapter cards such as CGA, EGA, and VGA.
Thirdly, to start graphics programming then you need two files which are GRAPHICS.H and GRAPHICS.LIB. These files are provided as part of the TurboC compiler.
